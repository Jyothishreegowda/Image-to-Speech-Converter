# Image-to-Speech-Converter

The main idea of this project is to recognize the text character from the image and

convert it into text and then to speech signal. The text contained in the page is first pre-
processed. The pre-processing module prepares the text for recognition. Then the text is

segmented to separate the character from each other. Segmentation is followed by
extraction of letters and resizing them and stores them in the text file. These processes are
done with the help of Python. This text is then converted into speech.
